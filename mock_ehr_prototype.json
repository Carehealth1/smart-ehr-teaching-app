  "description": "This mock EHR dataset mimics an ONC‑certified system with comprehensive patient data and an insurance education module. It contains ten synthetic patient profiles representing a broad range of coverage types (Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage HMO, Medicaid managed care, employer HMO, marketplace PPO, EPO, uninsured, charity care, dual‑eligible ACO, and capitated integrated system). Each patient record includes vital signs, medications, allergies, lab results, clinic visits, imaging reports, hospital admissions/discharges, insurance details, reimbursement model and a history of claims. Fifty interactive learning cases are provided to teach medical students how to navigate insurance processes. Each case references a patient, describes a realistic scenario, specifies tasks learners must perform in the EHR, provides the expected outcome, and states the learning objective. The insurance concepts are grounded in authoritative sources on insurance coverage, cost‑sharing and plan types【363281853880941†L21-L30】【456500307500387†L72-L100】.",
